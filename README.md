TLDR; I dig tech and coding, but I have a life, girlfriend and kids

Biography
- 👋 Hi, I’m @codelaxx
- 👀 I’m interested in Java, Python, Javascript, DevOps, Frontend, GameDev, IoT, NB-Iot/LTE-m/LoRa/LPWAN, arduino/esp/atmel, design, efficient and effective coding, deep skills
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Google cloud certifications, DevOps in general, frontend, and some fun GameDev projects to keep motivated (and that pesky Java-certification on the back burner, 10 years coming now, bah)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment, but I have a few things that are going to be huge in the social responsibility category, non profit øf cørse
- 📫 How to reach me? Catch me outside ;p

✨ On my spare time I...
- Shoot big and small guns, both modern and gun powder antiques, maybe a rifle in the future, love that smell of gun powder, chases away mosquitos
- Paddle kayaks, learning the eskimo paddle
- Ride my classic Honda Fireblade 954RR
- Maintain my Honda
- Patch up my 20 year old Subaru forrester, making sure it can still outrun Teslas and IPace-Jag on a good day
- Use my imagination
- Get schooled by my kids when it comes to use imagination
- Woodwork and fix my house, never ending annoying project, started out fun, now I want to move, give me money!
- Postpones fixing up my old wooden boat, will do it in some decades after retirement I think...
- Learn an insane amount of usefull and not so usefull stuff, both tech, coding, and just life, world, and universe related stuff
- Get ranked top 5% on all topics I have taken LinkedIn skill badges on, including Git, LoL!

✨ And I hope to do more in the coming months and years of...
- Competitive skeet shooting
- IPSC or Dynamic competitions
- Downhill or slalom with carving skiis, I have just put my Burton board away for a while or forever
- Reboot cross country since I finally got myself a little cottage with no electricity or water in the forrest
- Old boys biathlon, is that a thing???
- Open water swimming, yes, that's swimming in relatively cold water with a wet suite like it was in a pool, good stuff
- Do more cooking
- Launch 36 startups
